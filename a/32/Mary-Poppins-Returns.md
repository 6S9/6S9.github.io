### `欢乐满人间2 `Mary Poppins Returns

不要轻信你读到的东西
Don't believe the things you've read

明天已到  唤作今朝
Tomorrow's here, it's called today

所以细数数你的确幸吧  你是个幸运的家伙
So count your blessings You're a lucky guy

所以珍惜你们所爱的人
So hold on tight to those you love

也许不久的将来
And maybe soon from up above

你们的祝福将从天空降临  所以继续仰望吧
You'll be blessed, so keep on looking high

我娘亲的七舅老爷啊  他们又是这样
Great steaming clams! They've done it again!

恐怕前面波涛汹涌
Rough seas ahead, I fear!

律师
Lawyers?

我还以为你们能派上点用场呢
And here's me hoping you might prove useful.
![](陈qs)

你拿着我的拖把干什么
What you doing with my mop?
`这杯水想强j我`

恐怕最近让她做这种事会让我更麻烦
I'm afraid, lately, that means more work for me.

有一天我发现她把肉袋子
The other day, I found a butcher's sack

挂在衣架上
hanging on the coat rack

哦  杂货店  我昨天想去来着
The groceries. I meant to go yesterday.

好吧  腌鲱鱼做早餐
Very well. Pickled herrings for breakfast

橘子酱做午餐
and marmalade for lunch.

可你说过今天去公园啊
But you said we would go to the park today!

我们可以从公园穿过去
We can cut through the park on the way.

这年头恐怕得不停发救济粥
It's a never-ending job these days, I'm afraid.

忠信银行
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

这年头日子不好过  不是吗
It's hard enough these days, isn't it?

是吧  好  别说了
Yes. Well... Shh!

现在你已经
It seems you have fallen

欠了三个月的还款了
three months behind in your payments.

不好意思  银行现在要求你
Unfortunately, the bank is now demanding

付清全部贷款
that you pay back the entire loan in full.

你有五天时间
You have five days.

恐怕我们就得没收你的房子
I'm afraid we will have to repossess your home

亲爱的 我们太久未曾交谈
We haven't spoken in so long, dear

这一年过得昏暗无趣
This year has gone by in a blur

如今 似乎一切都轨迹错乱
Today, seems everything's gone wrong here

你画画的东西怎么在这
What are all your art things doing up here?

额 我没再用它们了
Oh. I wasn't using them anymore.

也许我该直接都扔掉算了
I should probably just get rid of it all.

真的 我们当初为什么要留下这个破烂
I mean, why on earth did we save this old broken thing?

以后可飞不起来了
Well, it won't fly anymore.

扔了吧
Out it goes.

不再追忆了
No looking back.

在我还活着的时候 终于
As I live and breathe.

但是我们不需要保姆
But we don't need a nanny.

妈妈教我们自己照顾自己
Mother taught us to look after ourselves.

我必须得指出 你们差点弄丢乔治
You did just misplace Georgie, I might point out.

只是差点 我们把他救回来了
Only slightly. We got him back.

你爸爸和我在小时候 我们也常常想象
When your father and I were young, we used to imagine...

你小的时候也有一样的问题
you had the same affliction yourself when you were young.

那些事 我们小时候的事情 不是真的......
Those things, when we were young, they didn't really...

-发生过吧 -不是
- Happen? - No.

-没发生过 -当然没有
- No. - Of course not.

太荒唐了
Ridiculous.

成人总是遗忘 总是
Grown-ups forget. They always do.

毕竟 我们已经好端端地
Well, we have grown up a good deal

长到这么大了
in the past year, after all.

因为它就是不能 这个想法本身就很荒谬
Because it can't. The very notion is ridiculous.

这根本说不通
It makes no sense.

如果说不通 就不可能是真的
And if it makes no sense, it can't be true.

因为才智可以赶走困惑
For intellect can wash away confusion

不错 逻辑是我们生存的基石
Yes, logic is the rock of our foundation

你们已经大到不会再相信想象
That you're far too old to give in to imagination

还以为现在他们学会了
You'd think by now they'd have learned

自己收拾
to pick up after themselves.

一切都有可能 就连不可能也是可能的
Everything is possible. Even the impossible.

- 是的 我来自爱尔兰 - 同时我也是一只狮子狗
- That's right, I'm Irish. - I'm also part poodle.

沙穆斯 你介意吗
Shamus, would you mind?

一点也不
Not in the least.

在幼儿园  你们从来都没独自完成过什么
In the nursery, you were never by yourself
![]()
巨婴g

你的身后有另一个世界
There was quite another world upon your shelf
![]()
微信

你会发现国王可能是个坏蛋
One discovers that the king may be a crook

你会发现你的第一印象是错的
You'll find your first impression was mistook

所以封面是好的  但是封面不是内容
For a cover is nice, but a cover is not the book
`a龖龖龖`

有一座城堡  这里住着一位娇气的国王
There was a castle with a king hiding in a wing

因为他从来没上过学
'Cause he never went to school

什么也没学过
To learn a single thing

他握着q杖和宝剑  还统治着上议院
He had scepters and swords And a parliament of Lords

但是实际上他很难过
But on the inside he was sad Egad!

因为他不识数
Because he never had a wisdom for numbers

也不认字
A wisdom for words

虽然他的皇冠很大
Though his crown was quite immense

但他的大脑比鸟还小
His brain was smaller than a bird's

五湖四海的学者们都来了
And they came from the East And they came from the South

他们把各个专业的知识提炼简化
From each college, they poured knowledge

把脑袋里的东西都讲出来
From their brains into his mouth

但是g王学不会
But the king couldn't learn

所以每个学者都面临着相同的命运
So each professor met their fate

那就是王后要砍掉他们的脑袋
For the queen had their heads removed

把它们挂在大门上
And placed upon the gate

`踩着企鹅爬上去`

- 封面很好  - 请采纳我们的意见
- A cover is nice - Please take our advice

- 封面很好  - 或者付出代价
- A cover is nice - Or you'll pay the price!

吉利
吉利

把吉利还给我
Give Gillie back!

我们以为他们是好人  但是他们是坏蛋
We thought they were nice, but they were mean!

你在说什么
Whatever are you talking about?

他们要抢走吉利
They tried to take Gillie!

你们担心太多了
You're all worrying far too much.

毕竟你不可能失去那些你从来没失去过的东西
After all, you can't lose what you've never lost.

可能那些你珍爱的东西
Well, maybe all those things that you love so

会在你丢东西的地方等你
Are waiting in the place where the lost things go

闭上眼睛
Time to close your eyes

才能进入梦乡
So sleep can come around

因为在梦里
For when you dream

你会发现所有不见的东西都已被找回
You'll find all that's lost is found

我要迟到了
I'm gonna be late.

对 我就是要迟到
That's all that I need!

不过  我的座右铭是  今日事今日毕
Still, today or never, that's my motto.

往那些小瓷娃娃脸上踢
Kick the little china dolls in their faces.

快就是慢  低就是高  停就是走  这就是为什么
Fast is slow, low is high Stop is go and that is why

一切都是因为世界正在颠倒
And all because the world is turning turtle

现在  白天是夜晚  狗是猫  黑是白  瘦是胖
Now day is night, dog is cat Black is white, thin is fat

东是西  进是出
East is west, in is out

`世溷浊而不清：蝉翼为重，千钧为轻；黄钟毁弃，瓦釜雷鸣；谗人高张，贤士无名。`

你看  当世界颠倒
You see, when the world turns upside down...

最好的办法是跟着它一起转
the best thing is to turn right along with it.

从你的位置换个角度看
When you change the view from where you stood

你所看到的一切将永远改变
The things you view will change for good

一切都取决于你看待事物的方式
It is all in the way that you look at things.

谁预料到这次经济失调
Who'd have thought this slump

会对生意这么好呢
would be so good for business, eh?

我是在做生意  不是慈善
I'm running a business, not a charity.

你不能再让班克斯拖延一秒钟
You are not giving Banks one more second...

还清贷款
to pay off that loan.

他就是要抢走  我们听到了
He is! We heard him!

威尔金斯先生是想办法帮我们
Mr. Wilkins is trying to help us!

现在我们可倒霉了 是吧
Now we've done it, haven't we?

我想我从没见过爸爸
I don't think I've ever seen Father

对我们这么失望过
that upset with us before.

但我们是告诉他真相
But we were telling the truth!

我们试着去补救的每件事  都被弄得更糟了
Everything we've tried to fix, we've only made it worse.

我们走哪条路  玛丽 波宾斯
Which way do we go, Mary Poppins?

现在为什么你要问我
Now, why would you ask me?

明明是你们三个在引路
The three of you are leading the way, after all.

在雾里面绕路
Walking around in a fog.

不  我们不是  我的意思是
No, we weren't. I mean,

我们是走在雾里  但是  我们只是在说话
we are in a fog, but...We were only talking.

是的  太专注于你们去过的地方
Yes, too focused on where you've been

以至于没注意你们将要走去哪儿
to pay attention to where you're going.

但是如果我迷路了
but if ever I lose my way,

我只需要找一点灯光指引我
I just look for a little light to guide me.

迷路了  当然
In a park, sure

你可以屈服于这黑暗  或
You can give in to the dark, or

你可以和我一起朝着光前行
You can trip a little light fantastic with me

当你独自在房间里
When you're alone in your room

你的选择只是拥抱这黑暗
Your choice is just embrace the gloom

或者你和我一起朝着光前行
Or you can trip a little light fantastic with me

因为如果你藏在被子里
For if you hide under the covers

你可能永远看不到白天
You might never see the day

但如果你内心生出一点火花
But if a spark can start inside your heart

那你就总能找到方向
Then you can always find the way

不要郁闷、皱眉或糟心  躺下
Mustn't mope and frown Or worse, lie down

别让它成为你的墓志铭
Don't let it be your epitaph

所以  当生活变得可怕时
So, when life is gettin' scary

做你自己的光芒
Be your own illuminary

奔向光亮简直太棒
To trip a little light fantastic!

莱利的工作就是照亮道路
A leerie's job's to light the way

让这夜晚变成白天
To take the night and make it day!

`有一分热,发一分光,就令萤火一般,也可以在黑暗里发一点光,不必等候炬火。此后如竟没有炬火,我便是唯一的光。`

天亮之前都是无尽黑暗
It's darkest right before the light

当你朝着光前进
As you trip a little light fantastic

为什么不朝着光前进呢
Won't you trip a little light fantastic?

所以当麻烦不断
So when troubles are incessant

就变得更积极
Simply be more incandescent

因为你的光将伴你一生
For your light comes with a lifetime guarantee

去银行
Went to the bank, rattle and clank

见大老板Pitch
Met with the boss Pitch and toss

`我要跟老板谈`

所以你一直在往孩子们的脑子里
So you've been off filling the children's heads

灌输些乱七八糟的东西
with stuff and nonsense.

你们差点害我丢了工作
You could have lost me my job.

懂吗
Do you understand that?

知不知道现在找个像我这样的好工作
Have you any idea how difficult it is to find

有多难
a good position like mine these days?

能做的我都做了  但这不是我一个人的事
to keep you all from worrying, but I can't do this on my own.

早上我还忘了带公文包
I can't even seem to remember my briefcase in the morning...

长大后我也想像你们这么聪明
I hope I'm as clever as you when I grow up.
`a龖龖囗`

你的母亲没有走  她在你的笑容里
Your mother's not gone. She's in your smile.

也在你的脚步里  约翰
And in your walk, John...

在安娜贝尔的眼睛里
and Annabel's eyes.

不管我们到哪儿她都跟我们在一起
And she'll always be with us wherever we go.

我一字没说
I never said a word.

都是孩子们自己的想法
It was all the children's idea.

事情被我弄得反过来了
I had it all backward.

班克斯家庭的传统
A Banks family trait.

终于从那久厨房解脱了
Good riddance to that old kitchen.

永远弄不清炉子怎么用
Never could figure out that stove.

收走房子吧
Take the house!

继续
Go ahead.

我已经拥有了我需要的一切
I have everything I need right here.

我几乎把这家银行的利润翻了一番
I've nearly doubled the profits of this bank.

是的  从顾客的口袋里压榨出的
Yes, by wringing it out of the customers' pockets.

所以  当他们告诉你你完了
So, when they tell you that you're finished

跳舞的机会没了
And your chance to dance is done

那就是时候开始演奏乐队了
That's the time to stand To strike up the band

并且告诉他们你才刚开始
And tell 'em that you've just begun

所以当生活是一场戏
So when life's a real pea-souper

你必须选择当个主角
You must choose to be a trouper

才能保证有戏可演
For your light comes with a lifetime guarantee

去银行
Went to the bank, rattle and clank

与老板见面玩投球
Met with the boss Pitch and toss

做一个孩子
To be a child!

如果觉得你的选择是对的
If your selection feels right

好吧  那就  亲爱的  抓紧了
Well, then, dearie, hold tight

如果你明白自己的心之所向那就随心而去
if you see your reflection your heart will take flight

简  我记得
Jane, I remember!

一切都是真的
It's all true!

我们和玛丽波宾斯想象的每一件不可能的事情
Every impossible thing we imagined with Mary Poppins...

这一切都发生了
it all happened!

把你的收成交给敌人
Give a lift to a foe For you reap what you sow

)

迪士尼公司将持有业主公司43%的股份，

因为没有地方可以去  只能上天
For there's nowhere to go but up

当你飞越城镇时  你会更加难以皱眉
As you fly over town It gets harder to frown

我们都会达到顶峰
And We'll all hit the heights

如果我们不往下看
If we never look down

让过去臣服 当下即永恒
Let the past take a bow The forever is now

当然  到明天大人都会忘记的
Of course, the grown-ups will all forget by tomorrow.

他们总是这样
They always do.

各个方面都非常完美
Practically perfect in every way.

我曾以为我再也感受不到
I never thought I'd feel

如此的欢乐与惊喜
this much joy and wonder ever again.

我以为那扇门已经永远对我紧闭
I thought that door was closed to me forever.
